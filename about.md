The goal of the *Busy Beaver game* is to find "programs" that will keep a Universal Turing Machine working
for the longest time before actually *halting*. It has been first described in 1962, and is a surprisingly 
difficult problem to solve for non-trivial machines.

[Fascinating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver), right ? And probably useless.

I have no intention of getting a shot at computability problems, but I'd like to keep track and/or share of a few
things that are worth more than 140 characters.

I am Mathieu Poumeyrol, a thirty-something geek based in Paris. I like designing software architecture, 
writing code, hunting bugs and performance or reliability issues (basically, solving puzzles). Over the last
years, I've mostly play with puzzles in scala, mongodb, ruby, and hadoop.

I'm looking for freelance jobs.
